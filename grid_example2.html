                         <h1>Information of Birds</h1>
                         <p>Birds are warm-blooded, egg-laying animals with feathers, wings, and beaks, found in nearly every habitat on Earth. They play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by pollinating plants, dispersing seeds, controlling pests, and cleaning the environment as scavengers. Birds are also important environmental indicators, helping scientists track changes in climate and ecosystems. Beyond their ecological roles, birds hold cultural, economic, and aesthetic value—contributing to agriculture, tourism, and art. With over 10,000 species, birds are essential to biodiversity and the health of our planet.</p>
